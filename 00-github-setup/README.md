# Chapter 00: GitHub Setup & Student Developer Pack

## Prerequisites for the Course

Before we can start coding, you need to set up your development environment. This chapter will guide you through getting GitHub Student Developer Pack, which gives you free access to GitHub Copilot and other essential developer tools.

## Why This Matters

- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-powered code completion that helps you write code faster
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud-based development environment (perfect for Chromebooks)
- **Free Tools**: Access to hundreds of dollars worth of developer tools for free
- **Industry Standard**: GitHub is used by millions of developers worldwide

## Two Paths to Success

### Option A: GitHub Codespaces (Chromebook Users)

Perfect if you're using a school Chromebook or can't install software locally.

### Option B: Local VS Code (Personal Computer)

If you have your own Windows, Mac, or Linux computer where you can install software.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Sign Up for GitHub Student Developer Pack

⚠️ **CRITICAL SCHOOL NETWORK ISSUE**: Our school blocks Google OAuth authentication. You MUST enter your email manually - do not click "Sign in with Google."

1. **Visit the Student Developer Pack Page**
   - Go to: `https://education.github.com/pack`
   - Click "Sign up for Student Developer Pack"

2. **Create Your GitHub Account**
   - If you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one
   - You can use your personal email if the school email doesn't work
   - You can add your school email later for verification

3. **Apply for the Student Pack**
   - **DO NOT** click "Sign in with Google" (it's blocked)
   - **INSTEAD**: Type your email address directly into the email field
   - Click "Continue with email"

4. **Complete Your Application**
   - Navigate to Settings → "Billing and licensing"
   - Select "Education benefits"
   - Click "Start an application"

5. **Verify Your Student Status**

   If your school email is recognized:
   - Instant approval!

   If not recognized, upload proof:
   - Student ID with current date
   - Current transcript or class schedule
   - Official enrollment letter

   Documents must clearly show:
   - Your name
   - School name
   - Current enrollment period

6. **Wait for Approval**
   - School email: Usually instant
   - Document upload: 1-3 days

### Step 2A: Setting Up GitHub Codespaces (Chromebook Users)

#### Creating Your First Repository

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Codespaces cannot be created from empty repositories!

1. **Create a New Repository**
   - Sign in to GitHub.com
   - Click the "+" button (top right)
   - Select "New repository"
   - **CRITICAL**: ✅ Check "Add a README file"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "my-first-project")
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Launch Your Codespace**
   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Select the "Codespaces" tab
   - Click "Create codespace on main"
   - Wait for your cloud environment to load

3. **Verify Copilot Works**
   - Create a new file: `test.py`
   - Type: `def calculate_`
   - You should see AI suggestions appear!

### Step 2B: Setting Up VS Code Locally (Non-Chromebook)

1. **Download VS Code**
   - Visit: `https://code.visualstudio.com`
   - Download for your operating system
   - Run the installer

2. **Connect GitHub to VS Code**
   - Open VS Code
   - Look for the Copilot icon (bottom status bar)
   - Hover and select "Set up Copilot"
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

3. **Access Levels**

   With Student Pack approved:
   - Unlimited code completions
   - Unlimited chat requests
   - Full AI model access

   While waiting for approval (free tier):
   - 2000 code completions/month
   - 50 chat requests/month
   - Still very useful!

4. **Test Your Setup**
   - Create a new file
   - Save as `test.js`
   - Type: `function add`
   - Gray suggestions should appear
   - Press Tab to accept

## Troubleshooting Guide

### "Can't sign in with Google"

- Use manual email entry only
- Type your email directly
- Never click OAuth/Google buttons

### "Can't create a Codespace"

- Repository must have at least one file
- Always add README when creating repos
- If repo exists, add any file first

### "Copilot not showing suggestions"

- Check Copilot icon in status bar
- Verify GitHub sign-in
- Confirm Student Pack status
- Try restarting VS Code

### "Document upload failing"

- Image must be clear and readable
- Keep file size under 10MB
- Use JPEG or PNG format
- Include current date on document

## Success Checklist

- [ ] GitHub account created
- [ ] Student Developer Pack application submitted
- [ ] Repository created with README
- [ ] Codespace or VS Code installed
- [ ] Copilot showing suggestions
- [ ] Ready to start coding!

## Need Help?

1. Check the troubleshooting guide above
2. Ask during programming club
3. Remember: Manual email entry is key!

## What's Next?

Once you have Copilot working, you're ready for [Chapter 01: Web Coding Basics](../01-web-coding/README.md)!
