# Current vs Legacy Content Guide

## ‚úÖ CURRENT CONTENT (Use This!)

### Core Curriculum

- **`README.md`** - Main introduction to AI-assisted approach
- **`00-Setup/`** - AI development environment setup
- **`01-Portfolio-Project/`** - Complete first project with AI guidance
- **`02-09-*-Project/`** - Project-based curriculum (ready for development)

### Supporting Resources

- **`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete transformation overview
- **`templates/`** - AI prompting guides, deployment docs, project templates
- **`resources/`** - Logos, promotional materials (still relevant)

## üóÇÔ∏è LEGACY CONTENT (Archived)

### Moved to `legacy/` directory

- **`COURSE.md`** - Old traditional curriculum outline
- **`PLAN.md`** - Original module-based structure
- **`Module 1-3/`** - Traditional exercise-based modules
- **`01-02 - Getting Started/`** - Old numbered chapter approach

## üéØ Key Differences

### Legacy Approach (Archived)

```text
Theory ‚Üí Exercises ‚Üí Simple Examples
- Module 1: Go fundamentals (syntax focus)
- Module 2: HTML basics (academic)
- Module 3: Simple web server (tutorial)
```

### Current Approach (Active)

```text
Plan ‚Üí AI Collaborate ‚Üí Build Real Apps ‚Üí Deploy
- Project 1: Portfolio website (production-ready)
- Project 2-9: Real applications with AI assistance
- Templates: Proven prompting strategies
```

## üìö What Students Should Use

### Start Here (Required)

1. **`README.md`** - Understand the new approach
2. **`00-Setup/`** - Set up AI development environment
3. **`01-Portfolio-Project/`** - Build first real application

### Reference Materials

- **`templates/prompting-guide.md`** - AI collaboration techniques
- **`templates/vercel-deployment-guide.md`** - Production deployment
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete transformation details

### Avoid (Outdated)

- Anything in `legacy/` directory
- References to "Module 1", "Module 2", etc.
- Traditional exercise-based learning paths

## üßπ Why We Archived the Old Content

### Problems with Legacy Approach

1. **Competing curricula** - Students confused about which to follow
2. **Outdated methodology** - No AI integration or modern practices
3. **Academic focus** - Exercises vs real application building
4. **Missing deployment** - No production hosting guidance

### Benefits of New Approach

1. **Clear path** - Single, cohesive AI-assisted curriculum
2. **Modern workflow** - GitHub Copilot integration throughout
3. **Real value** - Students build portfolio applications
4. **Industry relevant** - Current development practices

## üîÑ Migration Path

### For Existing Students

- Complete any current legacy modules if desired
- Switch to new approach for maximum benefit
- Use AI setup guide to upgrade development environment

### For New Students

- Skip legacy content entirely
- Start with current README and setup
- Follow project-based curriculum

### For Instructors

- Review `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for complete transformation overview
- Test new approach with pilot group
- Adapt project templates for specific needs

---

**Bottom Line**: Use current content for modern AI-assisted education. Legacy content preserved for reference but not recommended for active learning.
