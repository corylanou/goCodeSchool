# 00-Vibe-Starters: Your First AI Coding Adventures

## üéØ Welcome to Vibe Coding!

Before diving into full Go web applications, let's start with some fun, simple projects that introduce you to AI-assisted coding. These "vibe starters" teach you to collaborate with AI while building real things you can share immediately.

**Duration**: 2-3 hours each  
**Difficulty**: Complete Beginner  
**Tools**: Any AI coding tool (Replit, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or even ChatGPT)

## üöÄ What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding** means describing what you want to build in plain English and letting AI help you implement it. Instead of learning syntax first, you focus on:

- **Describing your vision clearly**
- **Iterating with AI feedback**
- **Understanding the generated code**
- **Testing and refining results**

## üìÅ Your First Vibe Projects

Complete these in order - each builds on the previous skills:
