Prompt 3: "Continuing with our blog platform, optimize the [component] we just created"
```

### Iterative Refinement

```text
"Improve this Go function:
[PASTE_CODE]

Make it:
1. More efficient
2. Better error handling
3. More readable
4. More testable

Show the improved version with explanations."
```

### Pattern Learning

```

## üö® Common Prompting Mistakes

### ‚ùå Vague Requests

**Bad**: "Make my code better"
**Good**: "Optimize this Go function for memory usage and add proper error handling"

### ‚ùå No Context

**Bad**: "Fix this error: cannot find symbol"
**Good**: "Fix this Go compilation error in my web handler: [full error + code context]"

### ‚ùå Too Broad Scope

**Bad**: "Build a complete e-commerce site"
**Good**: "Create a product catalog API with search functionality using Go and SQLite"

### ‚ùå Missing Requirements

**Bad**: "Add authentication"
**Good**: "Add session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing and middleware protection"

## üìä Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

### Good Prompts Produce:
