## üéØ AI Prompting Strategies

### The Five-Skill Framework

#### 1. Strategic Thinking

Before writing any code, plan with AI:

```text
"Help me plan a Go web application that manages student contacts. 
I need:
- SQLite database for storage
- Web interface with forms
- CRUD operations
- Deployment to Vercel

Create a project structure and technical specification."
```

#### 2. Effective AI Collaboration

Use context-rich prompts:

```text
"I'm building a Go web server with these requirements:
- Framework: standard net/http
- Database: SQLite with sqlc
- Frontend: HTML templates with HTMX
- Styling: TailwindCSS

Create the initial project structure with main.go, database schema, and basic routes."
```

#### 3. Validation Checkpoints

Always review AI-generated code:

```text
"Review this Go code for potential issues:
[paste your code]

Check for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Go best practices
- Error handling improvements"
```

#### 4. Debugging Mastery

Use AI for troubleshooting:

```text
"I'm getting this error in my Go application:
[paste error message]

Here's the relevant code:
[paste code context]

Help me understand what's wrong and provide a fix."
```

#### 5. Context Management

Maintain project knowledge:

```text
"Based on our previous conversation about the contact management app, 
now I want to add user authentication. 

Use the existing database schema and maintain consistency with 
the current code structure."
```

## üìö Prompt Templates for Go Development

### Project Setup

```text
Create a Go web application with the following structure:
- Project name: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
- Framework: [net/http | Echo | Gin]
- Database: [SQLite | PostgreSQL]
- Frontend: [HTML templates | HTMX | React]
- Deployment: Vercel

Include:
1. Project directory structure
2. go.mod file
3. Basic main.go with routes
4. Database schema
5. Environment configuration
```

### Feature Development

```text
Add [FEATURE_NAME] to my Go application:

Current stack:
- [List your current technologies]

Requirements:
- [Specific functionality needed]
- [User interaction flow]
- [Data storage requirements]

Please:
1. Update the database schema if needed
2. Create new routes and handlers
3. Update templates/frontend
4. Include error handling
5. Add basic tests
```

### Code Review and Optimization

```text
Review and optimize this Go code:

[PASTE YOUR CODE]

Focus on:
1. Performance improvements
2. Security best practices
3. Code readability
4. Go idioms and conventions
5. Error handling
6. Testing opportunities

Explain your suggestions and provide improved versions.
```

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

```text
Debug this issue in my Go application:

Error: [PASTE ERROR MESSAGE]

Code context:
[PASTE RELEVANT CODE]

Environment:
- Go version: [VERSION]
- OS: [OPERATING SYSTEM]
- Dependencies: [LIST RELEVANT PACKAGES]

Help me:
1. Understand what's causing this error
2. Provide a step-by-step fix
3. Suggest how to prevent similar issues
4. Add appropriate error handling
```
